## Game - Battle of the Plutonians

The game - ‘Battle of Plutonians’ is a “Branch and Bottleneck” choice based pattern game. In the game, the player being a Plutonian is set on a mission to save his planet, Pluto, from the greedy and cruel humans. The game begins with our Plutonian character waking up after being unconscious and his family being captured by humans. Throughout the story, the mystic crystals have been regarded as the magical tool with which the Plutonians can change avatars. Further to make the game more player-controlled, the game introduces multiple options and can lead the player to different branches based on the player’s initial choices. The player can find himself exploring and fighting against the robots, made by humans,  in a life and death Among Us [8] game to being hauled to a lab, or from being dumped as debris on to the mountain cliff to being stranded on a ship filled with robots. To keep the audience more engrossed, we have added multiple plot twists and spices to our narrative where the player has to actively play the game and deduce some key facts being presented throughout the game and use them in later stages. The game sounds difficult. Right? Here comes the time travel device to the rescue. Everytime the main character/protagonist is going to die, the player can use the time travel device to travel back in time. This device helps the player to explore different options and explore different branches further. Beware, the device is faulty and can lead you to some completely new place!
